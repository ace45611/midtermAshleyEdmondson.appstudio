3.  Program 3 (22.5%): Calculations

Scenario: Create a program that finds the average of three numbers times the square of the first number.  
Remember, no controls or events. 

Example:  
Say the user inputs the numbers 10, 20, and 30. The output would be:  
                The answer is 2000. 

Program 3 Requirements:

Created a new form named 'calculate'. 
Has a function named 'calcAvgSquare' with three parameters that calculates the average of 3 numbers times the square of the first number.  If the three numbers were 3, 4, and 2 you'd have:    
       ((3 + 4 + 2)/3) x 9  =  27 
Hint: how is 'squared' and 'multipy' written in Javascript? 
The main program gets 3 numbers from the user to use in the calculation. 
The main program uses 3 arguments and calls the function. 
The names of the function parameters and main program arguments are different. 
The function returns the answer to the main program.
The main program outputs the answer using a template literal and this format:  
       The answer is XXX.  
The program runs without error.

/*
function calcAvgSquare(num1,num2,num3){
    avgSquare = ((num1 + num2 + num3)/3) * ((num1 * num1))
    return avgSquare
}

number1 = Number(prompt("Enter a number"))
number2 = Number(prompt("Enter a second number"))
number3 = Number(prompt("Enter a third number"))

answer = calcAvgSquare(number1,number2,number3)
console.log(`The answer is ${answer}`)
